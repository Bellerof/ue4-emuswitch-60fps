## INFO BEFORE USING THE RESOLUTION MODS

>[!CAUTION]
You may have to change the Memory Layout in your settings (if you're using Yuzu and forks) to 6GB-8GB DRAM in case that you are using 1440p or 4K resolution mods.  

If you're playing on 4K you should almost certainly use 8GB DRAM.

If you're using Ryujinx then enable "Use alternative memory layout (Developers)" in Options -> Settings -> System.

>[!IMPORTANT]
**ONLY DO THIS IF YOU'RE FACING ISSUES LIKE CRASHES, BUGS ETC ETC.**

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.0.2.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch)

Here is a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/m-V6Rs2sm9w?si=-b10u6yv0dhih5Kk) by Grown Up Gaming on how to convert .pchtxt to .ips

>[!NOTE]

If you are playing on Switch don't try resolutions above 1080p. 

You will need more power and the Nintendo Switch is not powerful enough to support those resolutions.
