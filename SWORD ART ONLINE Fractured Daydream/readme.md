**TitleID: 010009D018A06000** **(JPN VERSION ONLY)**

**Supported languages**: [English, Japanese](https://i.gyazo.com/2c3e9516de957a9d1ac109ffc117f30e.png) 

## Mods Available

- 60FPS

>[!NOTE]
In this game you can't Disable Vsync (Control U/F1) or set the limit speed percent to 200 % to make it run at 60FPS. That's why you need the mod.

Also I prefer the mods option over Losless Scaling.

## Versions supported

- **1.1.1 | BuildID: 3AAA28C9CB8367B9**

## How to install the mods (for Emulators)

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60FPS\exefs\1.0.1.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
