60FPS mods for Unreal Engine games that are **lock to 30fps even if you disable Vsync** (Control U on Yuzu, F1 on Ryujinx) tested by myself.

I started doing UE4 Games, now some games are using UE5 too.

>[!NOTE]
I have decided to separate it from my [main mods repository](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods) for better identification.

>[!CAUTION]
These mods only work on the EU/US version of the games.
