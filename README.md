# ue4-emuswitch-60fps

60fps mods for UE4 (Unreal Engine 4) games that are **lock to 30fps even if you disable Vsync** (Control U on Yuzu, F1 on Ryujinx) tested by myself.

>[!NOTE]
I have decided to separate it from my [main mods repository](https://github.com/StevensND/switch-port-mods) for better identification.

>[!CAUTION]
These mods only work on the EU/US version of the games.
