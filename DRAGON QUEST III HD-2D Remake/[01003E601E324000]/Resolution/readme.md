> [!NOTE]
The Default resolution on **Docked** is weird. **It's 1440x812** once you load a save game.

Using these mods you will keep the resolution before loading your save and after loading your save.

Also if you use the 1080p mod that should be 720p on Handheld, etc etc.

On emulators, you can check the actual resolution using [ReShade](https://reshade.me/#download)

After installing it, go to the Add-ons tab.
