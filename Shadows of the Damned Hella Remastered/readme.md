Otherwise, follow the next instructions:

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name**. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.
