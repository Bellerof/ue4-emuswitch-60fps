Versions supported:

- **1.50** | **BuildID: 20503FA77FA416B7**

## NOTE

**If you're going to use the Uncap FPS mod**: Please use the version of the **mod that was designed for your emulator**.

Don't use both or the version that doesn't correspond to your emulator.

I mean: if you're playing on Ryujinx, use the Ryujinx version. If you're playing on Yuzu use the Yuzu version but **don't use both versions at the same time.**

Special thanks to:

- [Fl4sh_](https://github.com/Fl4sh9174) for the help making cutscenes 60fps or higher + speed up fix.

## Instructions

1. **Click on the folder of the mod that you want to use**

Then **Click on the .zip file name** (1.50_Kakarot60fps.zip) for instance. Finally **click on View Raw** to start the download.

2. Now open your emulator (Yuzu or Ryujinx). Right click on the game and Open Mod Data Location (for Yuzu)/Open Mods Directory (for Ryujinx).

3. Extract/Unzip the .zip file into this directory.

Your path should be something like this: `60fps\exefs\1.50.pchtxt`

**Switch users**: You can convert  the .pchtxt file to .ips using [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch) or just use [FPSLocker](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker)
